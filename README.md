# Hangman

## A repository containing work I completed in order to create a Hangman game

### Milestone 1

As part of this stage, I have used Python to build a random word generator that randomly picks a word from a given list of fruits, as well as to capture user input by using a built-in function in order to ask the reader to enter a single letter, also letting the reader know when an input is not valid. I have used Python as it is easily readable, as well as having a wide array of built-in functions that include those that I have used in this stage: "random" "input".
