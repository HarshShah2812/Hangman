# Hangman

## A repository containing work I completed in order to create a Hangman game

### Milestone 1

As part of this stage, I have used Python to build a random word generator that randomly picks a fruit from a given list, as well as to capture user input with the use of a built-in function ("input") where the reader is asked to enter a single letter, also letting the reader know when an input is valid and when it isn't with the use of an if/else statement. I have used Python as it is easily readable, as well as having a wide array of built-in functions e.g. "random".
